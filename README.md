# Frequentist-Inference-1A
Download the project file and work through the mini-project called Frequentist Inference 1A. Think of this assignment as both a demonstration and mini-project — you’ll be introduced to concepts like t- and z-tests, how to calculate standard deviation from a sample, and the Central Limit Theorem, and get some hands-on practice working with these concepts using simulated normal data. Complete your work in your own notebook and submit it to your GitHub account.
