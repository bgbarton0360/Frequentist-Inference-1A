# Frequentist-Inference-1A and 1B
Download the project file and work through the mini-project called Frequentist Inference 1A. Think of this assignment as both a demonstration and mini-project — you’ll be introduced to concepts like t- and z-tests, how to calculate standard deviation from a sample, and the Central Limit Theorem, and get some hands-on practice working with these concepts using simulated normal data. Complete your work in your own notebook and submit it to your GitHub account. 
Work through Frequentist Inference 1B. This mini-project was designed to give you additional practice using frequentist inference with real-world data from a hospital. You’ll use this same hospital dataset while working on the other two mini-projects in this unit. Complete your work in your own notebook and submit it to your GitHub account.
